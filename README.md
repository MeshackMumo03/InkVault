A state transition diagram is an elegant yet powerful visual artifact that maps the discrete states a user can encounter within a web application, along with the valid transitions triggered by user actions or system events. In the context of the presented Figma sequence, the state transition diagram captures the journey from the initial landing page through browsing the product gallery, viewing individual product details, interacting with the shopping cart, proceeding to checkout, and ultimately completing payment and receiving an order confirmation. By explicitly defining these states and connecting them with labeled transitions — for example, “Add to Cart” or “Proceed to Payment” — the diagram serves as a precise communication tool between designers and developers. It clarifies not only the static visual design, but also the dynamic behavioral logic of the application, ensuring consistent interpretation of user flows across a distributed development team. This documentation-oriented mindset helps identify missing transitions or unintended loops early in the collaborative cycle, making it a cornerstone artifact for robust, predictable, and user-centered web application development.
