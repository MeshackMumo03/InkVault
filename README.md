# Interface Related Diagrams

üéØ Purpose: Show how the frontend changes based on user state (e.g., logged in vs guest, loading vs loaded, etc.)

What is Included:
1. User States: "Guest", "Authenticated User", "Admin", "Suspended"
2. Frontend Views: Landing page, Dashboard, Profile, Error 403/404
3. Transitions: Trigger actions like Login, Logout, Session Timeout, Permission Change

# State Transition Diagram:

A state transition diagram is an elegant yet powerful visual artifact that maps the discrete states a user can encounter within a web application, along with the valid transitions triggered by user actions or system events. In the context of the presented Figma sequence, the state transition diagram captures the journey from the initial landing page through browsing the product gallery, viewing individual product details, interacting with the shopping cart, proceeding to checkout, and ultimately completing payment and receiving an order confirmation. By explicitly defining these states and connecting them with labeled transitions ‚Äî for example, ‚ÄúAdd to Cart‚Äù or ‚ÄúProceed to Payment‚Äù ‚Äî the diagram serves as a precise communication tool between designers and developers. It clarifies not only the static visual design, but also the dynamic behavioral logic of the application, ensuring consistent interpretation of user flows across a distributed development team. This documentation-oriented mindset helps identify missing transitions or unintended loops early in the collaborative cycle, making it a cornerstone artifact for robust, predictable, and user-centered web application development.


# User Flow Diagram:

A user flow diagram serves as a high-level yet deeply insightful representation of how users achieve specific goals within a web application, illustrating their path step by step from entry to completion. In the scenario presented, the diagram would trace a customer‚Äôs journey beginning with the landing page, progressing through the exploration of product categories, selecting an item, adding it to the cart, reviewing the cart, and finally completing checkout. Unlike a state transition diagram, which focuses on system states, a user flow diagram emphasizes the user‚Äôs intent and decision points, clarifying why each step occurs and how users navigate alternatives ‚Äî for instance, returning to continue shopping or applying a discount code before checkout. By highlighting these decision branches, a user flow diagram empowers distributed teams to design with empathy, aligning user motivations with the application‚Äôs functional pathways. This artifact is invaluable for validating user experience strategies, exposing potential friction points, and fostering a shared, user-centered vision across designers, developers, and stakeholders collaborating remotely.


# User Flow Sequence Diagram Explanation:

A user flow sequence diagram offers a structured and insightful way to visualize the step-by-step journey a user undertakes while interacting with a system, in this case a web-based e-commerce application. Unlike static wireframes, a sequence diagram explicitly captures not only what screens a user sees, but also the logical flow between their decisions, events, and system responses. For instance, a user might begin on a promotional landing page, navigate to a category listing, drill down to a product detail, and eventually proceed through a checkout process. Each transition is modeled as a clear arrow from one node to the next, showing both the order and the conditions under which navigation occurs ‚Äî such as ‚Äúif the cart is empty, skip to browse‚Äù or ‚Äúif logged in, jump to saved addresses.‚Äù This technique enriches collaboration by ensuring the entire team ‚Äî from developers to product owners ‚Äî sees how business rules, user intents, and interface elements interconnect across the journey. In practice, a user flow sequence diagram allows stakeholders to trace every alternative path a user might follow, anticipate potential dead-ends, and proactively address usability or technical gaps. Ultimately, by translating a product‚Äôs requirements into a sequentially visual roadmap, these diagrams empower teams to build user-centered, frictionless experiences that respect the natural habits of their audience.
